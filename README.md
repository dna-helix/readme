# My Leadership Interface: How I Work and Lead

## What’s This?
This document is a guide to how I work, lead, and collaborate. It’s not a set of rules—rather, it’s an introduction to my leadership philosophy and how we can work together effectively. As I step into my new role as CTO, I want to make sure everyone feels comfortable reaching out to share ideas, ask questions, and raise any challenges. This is a living document, and I’ll update it as I grow and evolve as a leader.

## My Leadership Philosophy
I believe in leading with clarity, transparency, and curiosity. My goal is to set a strong technical direction, remove roadblocks, and create a space where teams feel empowered to make decisions within their boundaries. I’m focused on building a culture of accountability and continuous improvement. I don’t believe in rigid processes but prefer to set guardrails that keep us aligned and adaptable, helping us innovate without unnecessary bureaucracy.

## How I Work
As CTO, my job is to define the high-level technical vision and ensure that we’re executing on it effectively. I want the team to take ownership and make decisions within their areas, trusting your expertise. I care about outcomes and efficiency, always seeking to provide maximum value with minimal resources. We’ll move fast but in a thoughtful, data-driven way, and I’ll support you in refining processes along the way.

## Communication Style
I believe in transparent, open communication. I prefer asynchronous updates—Slack, Jira, GitHub—so we can keep meetings focused on collaboration, problem-solving, and planning. Status update meetings aren’t necessary—let’s share progress and blockers in real-time and use our meetings for deeper conversations.

Feedback should be direct, timely, and constructive. If I give you feedback, it’ll be actionable and specific, and I always want to hear from you as well. If something’s on your mind, feel free to share it, whether that’s in a 1:1, through Slack, or however works best for you.

## What I Expect from You

* Take ownership of your work—whether it’s code, analysis, or strategy.
* Be curious, self-motivated, and data-driven. Ask questions, challenge assumptions, and drive progress.
* Focus on solutions, not blame. We’re all here to learn and improve.
* If something is outside your scope, escalate it. If you’re unsure or it involves multiple teams, I want to make sure we’re making informed decisions together.

## Making Decisions & Handling Conflict
In my view, decisions should be made with data, alignment to our goals, and collaboration in mind. If there’s a conflict or if a decision requires more resources or input from others, we’ll bring the right people to the table. I want disagreements to be constructive and based on evidence. If we don’t have enough data, we’ll work together to gather it and ensure we're aligned on long-term objectives.

## Growth & Development
I believe leadership is about empowering others. Everyone, regardless of title, can demonstrate leadership through ownership, initiative, and supporting their peers. Growth comes from stepping up, learning, and taking smart risks. I’m here to support you in pushing boundaries, growing your skills, and becoming a leader in your own right.

## How to Work with Me
I like to be approached early—whether it’s a problem, an idea, or something you want to brainstorm. Let’s work through things together, even when they’re still rough around the edges. Before escalating, try to think through potential solutions and bring your thoughts with you. I value independent thinking and will support you in tackling challenges head-on.

I manage my notifications carefully to balance focus and personal time. Feel free to ping me anytime, but I’ll typically respond when I’m available. In emergencies, don’t hesitate to call or text.

## What Success Looks Like
Success for me isn’t just about delivering on time or checking boxes. It’s about building a team that feels empowered, engaged, and aligned with our goals. I want us to learn from our experiences, continuously improve, and move toward something bigger. Ultimately, success is about creating a space where everyone is excited to contribute, take ownership, and grow.

## What I’m Still Working On
Leadership is a journey, and I’m always learning. Right now, I’m focused on:

* Delegation: Ensuring I empower my team without micromanaging.
* Scaling leadership: Finding ways to mentor and support leaders across the organization.
* Communicating vision: Ensuring our long-term goals are clear, aligned, and shared across teams.
  
This document will continue to evolve as I learn more about you, the organization, and how we can achieve our goals together.

## In Summary
I’m excited to work with all of you, and I want to build relationships rooted in transparency, accountability, and collaboration. Please feel free to reach out—whether you have an idea, a challenge, or just want to chat. Let’s make great things happen together.

### **My Manager README**  

#### **What’s This?**  
A Manager README is a guide to how I work, what I expect from my team, and how we can collaborate effectively. It’s not a set of rules, but rather a way to set expectations upfront so we can work together more smoothly. This is a living document—I’ll update it as I grow and evolve as a leader.  

### **My Leadership Philosophy**  
I believe in setting a clear technical direction, empowering teams to make decisions, and fostering a culture of curiosity and accountability. My goal is to remove roadblocks and enable innovation while maintaining efficiency and flexibility. I prioritize setting guardrails rather than rigid processes so that we can remain adaptable while staying aligned with our goals.  

### **How I Work**  
I set the high-level technical direction, but I want the team to make decisions within project boundaries. I prefer flexibility over rigid processes—guardrails help us stay efficient without unnecessary bureaucracy.  

I care about **communication, efficiency, and a data-driven approach.** I want us to provide maximum value with minimal resources. Automation is great, but only after we’ve nailed down the right process.  

### **How I Communicate**  
- I strongly prefer **async updates** (Slack, Jira, GitHub). Let’s keep meetings focused on planning, problem-solving, and brainstorming.  
- **No status update meetings, please.** We can handle those asynchronously.  
- **Feedback should be direct, timely, and constructive.** Let’s keep communication clear and helpful.  

### **How I Like to Give and Receive Feedback**  
Feedback is critical to growth, and I strive to make it a regular part of how we work together.  
- I aim to provide feedback **as soon as possible** after an event, whether positive or constructive.  
- My feedback will always be **specific, actionable, and focused on improvement.**  
- I encourage feedback from my team as well—I want to know how I can improve as a leader.  
- If you have feedback for me, I appreciate **directness and context.** Feel free to share it in a 1:1, over Slack, or however you feel comfortable.  

### **What I Expect from You**  
- Own your work—whether that’s code, analysis, or strategy.  
- Be **curious, self-motivated, and data-driven.** Ask questions, learn, and challenge assumptions.  
- Don’t blame or misdirect—focus on solutions.  

### **Making Decisions & Handling Conflict**  
- If a decision is **beyond your scope, conflicts with previous decisions, requires more resources, or impacts other teams**, escalate it.  
- I prefer to resolve disagreements with **data.** Is there evidence? Does it align with our long-term goals?  

### **Growth & Development**  
- I believe **everyone should demonstrate leadership**—titles don’t determine impact.  
- Growth comes from **taking ownership and pushing boundaries.** I’ll support you in taking smart risks.  

### **How to Work with Me**  
- Bring me **problems and ideas early.** I like brainstorming before things are fully baked.  
- **Think through solutions before escalating.** I appreciate thoughtful problem-solving.  
- I **control my notifications** to balance focus and personal time. Ping me anytime, but I’ll respond when I’m available. In emergencies, **call or text.**  

### **What I’m Still Working On**  
I see leadership as a continuous learning process, and I know there are areas where I can improve. Right now, I’m focusing on:  
- **Delegation** – Ensuring I empower my team without getting too deep into execution.  
- **Scaling leadership** – Finding ways to mentor and develop leaders across the organization.  
- **Communicating vision** – Making sure that our long-term goals are clear and aligned across teams.  

This README will evolve as I do, and I welcome feedback to make it better!
